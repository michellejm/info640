Data taken from the Journal of Statistics Education online data archive.
That archive in turn got the data from an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   (Mackowiak, et al., "A Critical Appraisal of 98.6 Degrees F â€¦", vol. 268, pp. 1578-80, 1992).

Data are:
(1) Subject's body temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit
(2) Gender - 1 = female, 2 = male
(3) Heart rate, in beats per minute
