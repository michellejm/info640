## Download R and RStudio

FIRST download R from the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) Repository. Select your Operating System and then follow the prompts.

For OSX: select the latest release of R (3.6+)
For Windows: select 'Install R for the first time'
For Linux: you probably got this without me.

THEN download RStudio from the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) website. Again, select your OS and walk through the prompts. 

That's it! If you open RStudio and see a blank screen with 3 or 4 quadrants, it was a success! If you are having trouble, be sure to alert Michelle ASAP.
